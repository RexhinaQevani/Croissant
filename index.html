      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for its historical
      crescent shape and, like other viennoiserie, are made of a layered
      yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
      several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique
      called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
      similar to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the
      Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.
      Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French
      bakeries and p√¢tisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early
      20th century. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen,
      pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that can be
      freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
      Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food,
      and as of 2008, 30‚Äì40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and
      patisseries were baked from frozen dough. Croissants are a common part of
      a continental breakfast in many European countries.
